SadConsole is a C#-based .NET cross-platform terminal, ascii, console, game engine. It simulates these types of programs and with it you can make ascii-styled games for modern platforms. At its heart, SadConsole is really a giant tile-based game engine. However, its object model is conceptually similar to a traditional console app.

While SadConsole is a generic library that doesn't provide any rendering capabilities, "host" libraries are provided that add renderers to SadConsole. The two hosts provided by this library are for **SadConsole.Host.MonoGame** and **SadConsole.Host.SFML**. When adding a host library to your project, you don't need to reference the base **SadConsole** package. If you use MonoGame, you'll also need to add a rendering NuGet package, such as **MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL**.

_SadConsole currently targets .NET 8, .NET 9, and .NET 10_
