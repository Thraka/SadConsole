SadConsole is a C#-based .NET cross-platform terminal, ascii, console, game engine. It simulates these types of programs and with it you can make ascii-styled games for modern platforms. At its heart, SadConsole is really a giant tile-based game engine. However, its object model is conceptually similar to a traditional console app.

While SadConsole is a generic library that doesn't provide any rendering capabilities, "host" libraries are provided that add renderers to SadConsole. The two hosts provided by this library are for **SadConsole.Host.MonoGame** and **SadConsole.Host.SFML**. When adding a host library to your project, you don't need to reference the base **SadConsole** package. If you use MonoGame, you'll also need to add a rendering NuGet package, such as **MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL**.

_SadConsole currently targets .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8_

## Features

Here are some of the features SadConsole supports:

- Show any number of consoles of any size.
- Uses graphical tile-based images to build out an ASCII-character font with support for more than 256 characters.
- Fonts are simply sprite sheet tilesets tied to ascii codes, you can use full graphical tiles if you want.
- Use more than one font file. However, each console is restricted to a single font.
- Full GUI system for interactive controls such as list boxes, buttons, and text fields.
- Importers for [DOS ANSI files](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_art), [TheDraw text fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheDraw), [RexPaint](https://www.gridsagegames.com/rexpaint/), and [Playscii](http://vectorpoem.com/playscii/).
- Animated consoles and instruction system to chain commands together.
- String encoding system for colors and effects while printing.
- Entity support for drawing thousands of movable objects on the screen
- Translating images to text-blocks.
- Keyboard and mouse support.
- Highly customizable framework.

## Example startup code

```csharp
using Console = SadConsole.Console;
using SadConsole;
using SadConsole.Configuration;
using SadRogue.Primitives;

Settings.WindowTitle = "SadConsole Examples";

// Configure how SadConsole starts up
Builder startup = new Builder()
    .SetScreenSize(90, 30)
    .UseDefaultConsole()
    .OnStart(Game_Started)
    .IsStartingScreenFocused(true)
    .ConfigureFonts(true)
    ;

// Setup the engine and start the game
Game.Create(startup);
Game.Instance.Run();
Game.Instance.Dispose();

void Game_Started(object? sender, GameHost host)
{
    ColoredGlyph boxBorder = new(Color.White, Color.Black, 178);
    ColoredGlyph boxFill = new(Color.White, Color.Black);

    Game.Instance.StartingConsole.FillWithRandomGarbage(255);
    Game.Instance.StartingConsole.DrawBox(new Rectangle(2, 2, 26, 5), ShapeParameters.CreateFilled(boxBorder, boxFill));
    Game.Instance.StartingConsole.Print(4, 4, "Welcome to SadConsole!");
}
```

```vb
Imports SadConsole
Imports Console = SadConsole.Console
Imports SadConsole.Configuration
Imports SadRogue.Primitives

Module Module1

    Sub Main()

        Dim startup As New Builder()

        ' Configure how SadConsole starts up
        startup.SetScreenSize(90, 30)
        startup.UseDefaultConsole()
        startup.OnStart(AddressOf Game_Started)
        startup.IsStartingScreenFocused(True)
        startup.ConfigureFonts(True)

        ' Setup the engine and start the game
        SadConsole.Game.Create(startup)
        SadConsole.Game.Instance.Run()
        SadConsole.Game.Instance.Dispose()

    End Sub

    Sub Game_Started(sender As Object, host As GameHost)

        Dim boxBorder = New ColoredGlyph(Color.White, Color.Black, 178)
        Dim boxFill = New ColoredGlyph(Color.White, Color.Black)

        Game.Instance.StartingConsole.FillWithRandomGarbage(255)
        Game.Instance.StartingConsole.DrawBox(New Rectangle(2, 2, 26, 5), ShapeParameters.CreateFilled(boxBorder, boxFill))
        Game.Instance.StartingConsole.Print(4, 4, "Welcome to SadConsole!")

    End Sub

End Module
```

## Latest changes

v10.4.0 (03/31/2024)

New versioning system. Versions for SadConsole will be in the following format: [all libs major].[all libs minor].[individual lib revision]

When patches come out for the indvidual libraries, the X in 10.0.X would increment. These would be like host updates, or the extended library, but not public facing changes in SadConsole itself. If SadConsole itself updates, the X in 10.X.0 would increment. All libraries would increment with SadConsole, and the individual lib revisions would reset to 0. The X on X.0.0 would indicate a major change to SadConsole with most likely a lot of bigger breaking changes.

That said, SadConsole is resetting all versions to v10.4.0 for this release. From now on, the new versioning system is in place.

- [Breaking] A minor breaking change. If you were creating your own `IConfigurator` startup configs, the `Run` method's parameter changed from `Game` to `GameHost`.

- [Core] Added `Components.Overlay` which displays a surface on top of an existing console/surface object as a top layer.
- [Core] Bug: `Font.OnFontChanged` wasn't actually being called. It is now.
- [Core] Added `Coroutine` NuGet library. This is included now with SadConsole.
- [Core] Added `CoroutineHandlerComponent` which is a manager that you can add to an object and coroutines to.
- [Core] `Cursor.PrintCoroutine` which prints as a coroutine, pausing at each character.
- [Core] `Instructions.DrawString` updated to use `Cursor.PrintCoroutine` which lets it pretty print word breaks.
- [Core] XML docs didn't genereate correctly for the last build.
